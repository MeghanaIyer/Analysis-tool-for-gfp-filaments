# Analysis-tool-for-gfp-filaments
Tool for identifying length and position of filament in a cell. Current analysis done on Caulobacter cresentus cells.
This script is written to determine various parameters such as: 
1. filament length - under variable name: 
2. total intensity of filament- under variable name: 
3. position occupancy of filament- under variable name: The input data is from two sources: an image file for analysis and 
the respective analysis file from oufti. The "mesh" data generated by oufti is utilized to segment the cell from the image 
and further analysis is carried out. Each section (demarcated by '%%') has a brief description of the fuctions carried out 
in the section.
